ADSS Safety & Security Policy
===============================

In line with our School Vision of Values-Centric, Thinking School, Admiralty Secondary School is committed to providing ‘A Safe and Secure School for All’; an environment which is conducive for learning and working for all students, staff and stakeholders. Our mission is nurturing a culture of Safety and Security Awareness among students, staff and stakeholders and to equip our students and staff with the relevant knowledge, skills and competencies so that everyone can take responsibility for their own safety and security.  

Guided by our school’s core values (LIGHTS), our students and staff contribute towards elevating the standards of safety and security in the school as follows:

<table>
	<tr> 
		<td> Learning </td>
		<td> Learning and familiarising safety and security procedures and practices
</tr> 
	<td> Integrity 
		<td> Knowing and doing the right things to keep the environment safe and secure
</tr> 
<td> Graciousness 
	<td> Demonstrating care for the safety and security of self and others
</tr> 
<td> High Expectations  
<td> putting in effort to maintain high standards of vigilance and safety and security practices
	</tr> 
<td> Teamwork
<td> Cooperating with the school by reporting defects and safety and security hazards
</tr> 
<td> Self-discipline
