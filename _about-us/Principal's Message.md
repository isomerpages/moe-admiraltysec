Principal's Message
===================

Dear Admiralty Secondary School Family, Parents, and Admirals,

At Admiralty Secondary School, we believe every Admiral is the hero of their own story, and our mission is to **Empower Admirals to Actualise their Aspirations**. We are excited to embark on our "next bound" together, a journey that was shaped by deep, transformative conversations during our recent **Key Personnel and Staff Retreats**. Moving beyond simple refinements, we utilised **Double-Loop Learning** to question our underlying assumptions and reframed our goals to ensure we are truly serving our students’ needs.

This collaborative process has led us to a refreshed vision that we are eager to share with everyone.

To help our Admirals navigate a changing world with confidence, we are anchoring everything we do in two powerful **Strategic Approaches:**

• **Design Thinking Mindset:** We are nurturing a culture where we approach every challenge through **empathy, defining the problem, ideating, prototyping, and iterating.** This mindset transforms "failure" into a valuable step for growth and resilience.

• **Empowering Voice and Agency:** We believe our school experience should be **co-created.** By giving students a **voice** to share their ideas and the **agency** to take responsibility for their learning, we ensure they are the active architects of their own growth.

Our shared efforts are directed toward three refreshed **Student Outcomes**, which serve as the destination for every Admiral’s four-year journey:

1. **Future-Ready Problem Solver:** Adaptive thinking, Shaping tomorrow. Our Admirals will learn to navigate real-world problems with innovation and adaptability.

2. **Active Citizen:** Actively representing, Serving community. We are growing individuals who make values-based decisions and contribute meaningfully to those around them.

3. **Caring Leader:** Leading heart, Inspiring change. We empower our students to support their peers with care and lead positive transformation within our school and beyond.

We invite every parent and partner to join us in this inspiring mission. Our school motto, **"Be a Guiding Light that Shines,"** reminds us that when we work together with a common purpose, we can illuminate the path for our Admirals to achieve their dreams. This is a future full of possibility, and we look forward to shaping it together.

**Full steam ahead, Admirals!**

Warm regards,<br>
Mr Tan Kelly<br>
