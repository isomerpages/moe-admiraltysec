Principal's Message
===================

Dear Admirals,  

The Secondary School experience is one of the most exciting phases in one’s educational journey. We make some of our best friends and gain new experiences. These are crucial years in building a strong foundation as we prepare for the future. Hence, at Admiralty Sec, we have lined up a series of academic and co-curricular programmes to provide our Admirals with the necessary skills and knowledge to actualise their aspirations.

For instance, Admirals get to enjoy learning about Design Thinking through Technology & Innovation, which prepares them as solution designers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-related professions (our Applied Learning Programme (ALP)). As part of our Character and Citizenship Education, Admirals develop Mindful Leadership through Community Outreach (our Learning for Life Programme (LLP)) anchored in our school values of **L**ife-long Learning, **I**ntegrity, **G**raciousness, **H**igh Expectations, **T**eamwork and **S**elf-Discipline (LIGHTS).

Through these learning experiences, Admirals learn about themselves and become future -ready thinking citizens anchored in values. They shall be ready to lead change and contribute to the society.

Together with my dedicated team of staff, I look forward to partner you in nurturing every student into Confident, Concerned, Self-directed and Contributing Admirals.  

May I also wish every Admiral a meaningful and successful learning journey in actualising your aspirations.

  

Mr Lam Yui-P’ng

Principal, Admiralty Secondary School
