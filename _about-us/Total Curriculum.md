ADSS Total Curriculum Framework 

**Objectives**

The ADSS Total Curriculum framework supports the core priorities of our school organisation and is designed with three key objectives:

*   To ensure our Admirals have the knowledge, values, skills and competencies to cope with the challenges in the 21st Century.
*   To provide a common reference point to articulate the key domains aimed at cognitive, behavioural and affective engagement.
*   To facilitate a common language amongst staff as they engage in professional dialogues/discussions to improve student learning outcomes.

**Learner** 

The learner is at the core of the framework to indicate learner-centricity in our holistic approach to growing our students. 

The primary aim is to nurture our students to be equipped with the core skills and competencies, not merely academic content, as well as imbued with moral values that can equip them with the resilience and tenacity in a VUCA world.

Developing the whole child must first begin with instilling the right values; henceforth a learner-centric, values-based approach. In ADSS, Learner-centricity anchors on our LIGHTS values which stands for ‘Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Graciousness, High Expectations, Teamwork, Self-Discipline’ to create a strong learning environment that enhances academic attainment and develops students' social and relationship skills. 

  

**Relationship between Curriculum and Content, Pedagogy, Assessment and 21CC** 

Curriculum and Content, Pedagogy and Assessment are three interdependent and inter-related domains of knowledge and skills that facilitate the design of learning experiences (both for academic content and co-curriculum) to meet the needs of diverse learners. 

Learner-centric teaching is connected with teaching practices that accommodate the needs of each individual student. This includes teaching principles such as differentiated teaching through class banding and individualised teaching through remediation sessions.

But education is more than just the acquisition of content knowledge. Fundamentally learner-centricity is about nurturing the whole person; including his moral, social, emotional and practical skills.

In order to function effectively in a knowledge economy and digital world, our students must have skills such as problem solving, communication, collaboration and critical thinking that they can use when faced with new challenges and experiences. These skills are part of the 21st Century competencies (21CC) that are integrated into the Total Curriculum.

Indeed our iconic programmes such as Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) are themselves focused on the development of students’ 21st century competencies

**Four Desired Student Outcomes**  

The four desired students outcomes epitomises the interrelationship between all the domains reflected in the Total Curriculum framework and the manner in which each domain function reframes curriculum as a coherent experience with the primary focus on the Learner. 

Learner-centricity is focused on developing the whole student and recognizes that learning is not restricted to the classroom environment. The nature of the learning process has to be deliberate in constructing meaning from academic content, information and experience so that our learners can be engaged, self-directed and takes personal responsibility for contributing to their own learning.

However the knowledge and skills acquired must be anchored on our ‘LIGHTS’ values to sustain a values-centric future-ready Admiral who exhibits the qualities of  a Self-Directed Admiral, a Concerned Admiral, a Contributing Admiral and a Confident Admiral.

*   **A** **Confident Admiral** has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively;
*   **A Self-Directed Admiral** takes responsibility for his own learning, who questions, reflects and perseveres in the pursuit of learning;
*   **A Contributing Admiral** is able to work effectively in teams, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks, is innovative and strives for excellence; and,
*   **A** **Concerned Admiral** is rooted to Singapore, has a strong civic consciousness, is informed, and takes an active role in bettering the lives of others around him.
