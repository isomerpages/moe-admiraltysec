**Objectives**

Admiralty Secondary School offers Computing as an 'O' Level subject to provide students with the foundation in logical thinking, computational thinking and skills to participate in a rapidly changing technological environment.

In alignment with the school's vision -- Values-centric, Thinking School, the subject involves formal reasoning, logic and algorithmic thinking, and the reformulation of a problem so that a computer-based solution is viable. It allows students to develop their ideas and creativity through the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and hence contribute to society.

**Approaches**

The teaching of Computing is largely anchored by applied learning. Students approach the learning based on solving open-ended problems and learn by doing. With integrative use of hardware and software, students created new artefacts to solve real-world problems. They devise solutions using Phyton and Excel Spreadsheets.  

Students are also required to produce a programming project that involves the use of Raspberry Pi to carry certain tasks such as temperature monitoring and word display. They have to read datasheets, connect the electronic components together and code solutions to achieve the objectives.
