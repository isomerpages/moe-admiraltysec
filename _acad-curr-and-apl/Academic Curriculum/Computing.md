It allows students to develop their ideas and creativity through the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and hence contribute to society.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;"><b><u>Approaches<br></u></b>The teaching of Computing is largely anchored by applied learning. Students approach the learning based on solving open-ended problems and learn by doing. With integrative use of hardware and software, students created new artefacts to solve real-world problems. They devise solutions using Phyton and Excel Spreadsheets.</span><br></p><p>Students are also required to produce a programming project that involves the use of Raspberry Pi to carry certain tasks such as temperature monitoring and word display. They have to read datasheets, connect the electronic components together and code solutions to achieve the objectives.</p></div>

Programmes
----------

<p style="text-align: center;" class="">&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent;"><u style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Three</u><br></span></p>

**Python Programming**  
  
In GCE O-level Computing, students are taught how to go through a systematic process of thinking when solving problem (abstraction), formulating steps for solutions (algorithmic thinking) and writing computer programs (programming/coding) to produce the solutions.  
  
Python programming is used extensively especially for modules on Abstraction, Algorithm and Programming. Students learn to code computer solutions for various real-world problems so that they could develop computational thinking skills, as well as apply concepts and skills taught.

**Programming with Raspberry Pi and SenseHat**

  

As part of the initiative to develop an appreciation to value-creation through programming, students attended Young Tech Makerfest 2017 and learned programming with Raspberry Pi and SenseHat. In this workshop, participants are introduced to basic python commands and data structures to access and control the various elements on a SenseHat. The hands-on sessions allows students to learn as they construct, and even hone their troubleshooting skills to manipulating different lines of codes to arrive at a desired outcome.

**Experiential Learning**

As ICT can be sometimes abstract to students, the use of ICT could be appreciated better with experiential learning through reflection.  Students experience actively the integrative use of software and hardware that open up ways for work, play and living.  They consciously reflect on the experience and conceptualize a theory and model of what is observed.  They articulate and present their theory and extend their learning to solve more problems in real world context.  These are critical leading to more meaningful learning.
