Introduction
------------

 Through a systematic approach to solving design problems, the Design and Technology unit aims to provide the platform for students to acquire 21st Century Skill through a design focused curriculum, involving research, reasoned application of knowledge and skills in the areas of design and technology.

Lower Secondary Students develop positive values and develop disposition for enterprise, creativity and innovation through the guided design journal. They get to explore, conceptualise ideas and development, graphics communication and work with materials using appropriate hand tools.

Upper Secondary Students carry on their learning of the design process and technology at a higher level and intensity. They prepare self-initiated design journal and presentation boards to develop their resolve through continuous improvement of their project ideas within a given timeframe.

**DesignRete for Secondary 3 D&T students**

All secondary three students taking D&T attended a 3-Day workshop organized by Design Rete. They were taught to recognize and communicate their ideas using the different mode of design presentation among several other things. They also get to design a simple product through a brief design cycle that involves modeling.

On the last day of the workshop, they went to the Red Dot Museum to gain insights to what inspires designers to create useful and aesthetically pleasing product.

**Infusion of Robotics**

The infusion of robotics in D&T curriculum continues in upper secondary D&T. Students from secondary three learn about the functions and applications of mechanism through building simple machines like pulleys and gear trains. In the process of building, students also observe and record the characteristics of each simple machine in the worksheets given.

Students were excited playing with LEGO during lesson. The LEGO manipulative allows opportunities for teamwork, experimenting and of course, fun! In fact, students were taking the initiative to combine the different simple machines they have learnt to build once they have completed the assigned tasks.

**Co-operative Learning of Mechanism using Lego Education Kit**

Students learn the topic of Mechanism using the Lego Education Kit. They follow the instruction booklet to construct various types of mechanisms and then manipulate them to understand their input, process and output.

 **Electronics Lesson using Manipulatives**

Using the Electronics Snap Circuit, students learn the various electronics components and how they are connected to form different circuits that do interesting things, for example, making a siren sound and causing a propeller to fly upwards.

**Lower Secondary**

**Directed Design Journal**

In the D&T curriculum, Lower secondary students in ADSS go through a directed design journal through simple design projects like a pencil organiser. They learn to appreciate aesthetic designs and functionalities. Through simple and fun activities, the students learn to be observable to the surrounding, constantly seeking design opportunities.

**Ideation, Conceptualisation and Development using Tablet PC**

Students engage in ideation process using the Sketchbook Pro software on their Tablet PC to produce different designs for a bag. They then present their concepts to a panel of ‘clients’ who will give them feedback. The chosen design is then further developed for production.
