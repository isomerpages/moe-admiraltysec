Introduction
------------

The Humanities Department of Admiralty Secondary School comprises the following subjects:

*   Combined Humanities (Social Studies, Geography and History Electives)
*   Elements of Business Studies (EBS)
*   Lower Secondary Geography and History
*   Lower Secondary Social Studies (Normal Technical)

The Humanities Department hinges an inquiry – based learning set within an authentic learning environment as its main Teaching and Learning approach. We believe that this will help our students to make sense of issues in the world that they live in. These societal issues cross not just disciplinary boundaries, but also national and geographical ones. By encouraging inquiry within an authentic learning environment, our students’ curiosity is sparked and this will lead them to question what they already know as well as what they would like to know about the issues.

Inquiry – based learning teaches our students how to gather accurate and relevant information, and to analyse them meaningfully through lenses that can provide new insights and understandings to these issues. This helps our students make well-reasoned, evidence-based conclusions that can be used to improve or better understand something, and to take action that benefits our society. Also, inquiry-based learning takes on a more reflective character as the Humanities invite different perspectives from people and different solutions to problems. Our Admirals are required to think critically about the evidences being used to support different conclusions and decisions.

<br>
The IHGI combines the processes for the Geographical and Historical Investigations (GI & HI) where our students investigate both the geographical and historical issues in one location. Students will analyse the GI and HI questions and plan their research, gather and select data, analyse data and construct their geographical and historical interpretations. The IHGI gives our students opportunities to appreciate the connection between Geography and History in the real – world application of geographical and historical knowledge and skills.  

  

Inquiry is recommended for the learning of concepts, skills and the exploration of issues in the SS N(T) syllabus. Inquiry-based learning helps students to become more critical about their thinking and their actions. Hence, they will be able to deliberate and offer well-grounded answers based on evidence in the study of issues. It also sustains the N(T) students’ interest as they would have the opportunity to investigate into an area of focus that is related to the world outside the classroom.

<br>

Inquiry-based learning in the Combined Humanities seeks to spark and build on students’ curiosity, so as to create meaningful learning. Questions are used to activate students’ prior knowledge and challenge their assumptions, as multiple perspectives are presented for their consideration. This in turn leads to the eliciting of students’ own questions out of curiosity. Thus, learning in the Combined Humanities is achieved through inquiry as it is driven by teachers’ and students’ questions to investigate, extract, analyse and synthesise information regarding issues, be they societal, geographical or historical in nature.

For the Upper Sec Humanities, students are also involved in competitions like the National Earthquake Competition organized by Singapore Polytechnic and The History Challenge organized by Bendemeer Sec. These competitions allow them to apply their learning of Geography and History into real life situations. In addition, our students have been involved in the Model Unite Nations Conference since 2013 where they are exposed to world affairs and appreciate the importance of a world body to address pertinent issues facing the various countries.

EBS provides an authentic learning experience by getting students involved in the EBS Learning Journey and the 2 Day 1 Night Travel and Tourism Learning Journey. These enable our students to experience first-hand what they have learnt in EBS, particularly in the Travel and Tourism industry.

  

During the EBS Learning Journey, e.g. Orchard Road, students are able to see and study the concepts that they have learnt in the classroom in action in real life. In addition, the 2 Day 1 Night Travel and Tourism Learning Journey includes a section where our students serve as Tour Guides to a group of elderly, giving them the opportunity learn the skills of being a tour guide. This also serves as an incentive program to motivate them to do well in their subject and be shortlisted.
