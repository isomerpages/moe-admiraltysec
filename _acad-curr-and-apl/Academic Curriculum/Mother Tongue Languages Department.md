Introduction
------------

Through the provision of a values-based and student-centric learning environment, we strive to grow our students’ interest in and love for the Chinese/Malay language and culture, and motivate them towards excellence in the Mother Tongue Language. We also aim to instil in students an appreciation of the thinking and values that underlie our cultures. As we nurture them to be responsible and active users of their mother tongue, they will be learned, future-ready persons who contribute to society.

本部门以价值观为本，打造以学生为中心的优越学习环境，培养学生对母语和华族/马来族文化的兴趣，进而激发他们投入到母语的学习里。本部门也力求灌输学生正确的传统价值观，让他们了解并珍惜本族文化。毕业自美雅中学的学生，会是能善用母语，有责任感，并能面向未来，贡献社会的好公民。

Melalui suasana pengajaran dan pembelajaran berteraskan nilai, kami berharap dapat menyemai minat dan cinta pelajar terhadap bahasa dan budaya Melayu. Dalam masa yang sama juga, merangsang mereka meraih kecemerlangan dalam Bahasa Melayu. Kami juga berhasrat agar dapat memupuk penghayatan dan pemikiran nilai-nilai murni yang menjadi asas budaya kita kepada pelajar. Diharap melalui pendidikan nilai-nilai ini, mereka menjadi pengguna yang bertanggungjawab dan aktif menggunakan Bahasa Melayu serta sentiasa bersedia menyumbang kepada masyarakat pada masa hadapan demi menyahut seruan visi Arif Budiman.

 **Approaches**

At Admiralty Secondary School, using Design Thinking, Mother Tongue Language teaching and learning is meaningfully designed to cater to the profiles and needs of our students.

*   **Customised teaching and learning** \- Learning is pitched at each student’s ability by teachers with relevant expertise. Higher ability students will have the opportunity to offer Higher Mother Tongue Language and Literature in Chinese/Malay (Elective). Students who require more support will learn at an appropriate pace with customised materials.
*   **Authentic learning** \- Cultural exposure via learning journeys and overseas cultural immersion in Brunei and China offer students real-life exposure to the use of their mother tongue and enhance their appreciation for the language and culture.
*   **Integration of ICT** \- The use of ICT is prevalent for greater relevance to students’ life and future, as well as to offer immediate feedback on students’ learning progress.

**Reading Programme**

The Mother Tongue Reading Programme aims to increase students’ cultural understanding and exposure to current affairs by providing reading materials designed for students of different MT ability every fortnight. The materials also complement the MTL curriculum as well as our school’s activities and events such as Total Defence Day and International Friendship Day. Soft copies of the materials are available for students’ downloading and reading using their mobile devices.

In 2017, the Chinese Unit embarked on a journey with then Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning as a "Chinese Language Reading Ambassador". More students will benefit from an enhanced Reading Programme in 2019.
