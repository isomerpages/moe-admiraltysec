**Boomwhackers**

Students play the notes by hitting the boomwhacker onto any surface, mainly the palms of their hands to produce sound. Each boomwhacker produces different sounds/ pitches depending on the length of the boomwhacker. Students are assigned one boomwhacker each to play a note that is assigned. Students work as a class and in groups to play a piece of music. Each individual plays a part in performing a complete piece.
