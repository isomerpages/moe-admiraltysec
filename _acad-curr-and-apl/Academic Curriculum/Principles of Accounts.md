Introduction
------------

Principles of Accounts (POA) is a subject offered to selected Secondary 3 and 4 students. The subject aims to instill in students the basic knowledge in making sense of accounting information. Through this subject, the school values Self-Discipline and High Expectations are being inculcated in students through classroom expectations and daily teaching and assignments.

POA syllabus codes 7088 (Normal Academic) and 7175 (Express) are designed to provide students with a meaningful basic introduction to financial accounting and to develop an appreciation in the discipline of accounting. It is grounded in preparing, communicating and using financial information, and thus appreciating the need for ethical conduct.
