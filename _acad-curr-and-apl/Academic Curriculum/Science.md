Introduction
------------

Admiralty Secondary School Science Department aims to be an incubator of innovative enterprising students who aspire to be the best they can be. We aim to nurture students to appreciate the wonders of science and to poster a spirit of thinking and innovation through a forward looking and engaging curriculum.  We believe that every student is curious and inquisitive about science and can be nurtured to be inventive and investigative. 

The science curriculum is broadened and enhanced with Robotics and Engineering STEM ALP as the application of science lessons.  Lessons at lower secondary levels are designed where students make connections between science concepts learnt in classrooms and authentic applications in the real world.  During the course of study, students are thought thinking tools to learn to thinking and logical reasoning to make connections between concepts and to solve problems.  Students also have opportunities to interact with engineers, programmers and scientists to understand role of science and technology in solving real world problems.

**Problem Solving and Connecting with Real World** **\- Robotics and Engineering STEM-ALP lesson within science curriculum**

All lower secondary students are exposed to real world solutioning through STEM and Design Thinking (DT) in ALP.  These subjects are integrated respectively in science and design and technology lessons. In STEM, students learn about microcontroller construction and coding therefore linking the content of electronics and electricity to real world.

As part of the learning and exposure in STEM – DT ALP, students visit the assistive technology laboratory at Nanyang Polytechnic to appreciative how STEM is applied in real world authentic context.  They also interact with practicing engineers through visits to engineering exhibitions to appreciate applications of engineering in today’s world.

Through the ALP, students had a total learning experience from hands on construction, to programming to learning journeys to real world applications to possibilities of STEM careers

**One-one computing using iPAD to access online resources and create content**

Students use personal iPAD tools eg imovie to capture their learning and reflections of their experiences in their ALP.  Students learn simple storyboarding when creating their video products. They are encouraged to share their ALP learning through videos with their family members

Teachers use iPAD to design science lessons for students by using open tools or relevant apps or they infuse apps in their lessons.  These allow students to interact with peers and with content as they are engaged in the lessons.  Thinking routines are used to structure and guide students as they solve problems and to make the thinking process explicit

**Stretching more able students through competitions**

High performing students have opportunities to be stretched beyond their syllabus through participation in science competitions at national level eg National Science Challenge or the ACJC Science Quiz  Teachers use exploratory approach using laboratory materials to expand and deepen students’ grasp of new highly abstract science concepts.
