Introduction
------------

Admiralty Secondary School was highly successful in 2006, then a 4 year old school, to be awarded Robotics Enterprise Niche. Since then, the school has successfully carried out multi-disciplinary learning of various subjects through robotics themed Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW). 

IPW was about bringing together different curriculum subjects, framed by a robotics theme in an authentic setting.  From 2015, the school has embarked on the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) to ensure that all our students acquire a broad and deep foundation for a lifelong journey of learning. 

Through curriculum re-design, the school has adopted a novel approach to ALP by integrating Design Thinking (DT) with Robotics and Engineering (STEM) with learning journeys (LJs) and enriched with interactions with practicing engineers from industries and Institutes of Higher Learning.  This novelty is realised where students experience a total seamless learning experience through STEM, DT and LJs all integrated together.  This unique ALP is entitled **Design Thinking through Innovation and Technology.**

This ALP is deliberately designed as an overlap of STEM and DT.  DT seeks to nurture in our students a caring heart with a desire to empathise with others and to help others, while STEM programme seeks to impart content in science, design & technology, engineering, programming.   When put together the desired outcomes of our students are 

*   Confident students who are equipped with 21CC skill-sets for future workforce and are ready to serve the community
*   Self-Directed studentswho leverage on technology to stay relevant with in-depth learning and skills acquisition
*   or in short a caring and future-ready engineer

  

From the outset, ALP was planned in an integrated manner through cross functional groups comprising staff from the school’s science department, craft and technology department and staff from Nanyang Polytechnic and STEM Inc (of Singapore Science Centre).  This led to a synergy of strengths when designing ALP for students leading to a smooth seamless implementation.  To students, there is a connection between their core syllabuses of science and design and technology and with STEM and DT, which is further enriched with a LJ to the polytechnic’s assistive technology laboratory to appreciate how solutioning takes place in real life authentic settings by engineers.

In the ALP through DT, students are thought various tools to empathise, define, ideate and prototype possible solutions to attempt to solve problems.  Students also have opportunities to interact with engineers, programmers and scientists to understand role of science and technology to define problems while solving existing ones.  In STEM students learn about Arduino micro-controllers and coding to appreciate how engineers integrate electronics and computing to design robots, to serve various needs.  Currently students work on robotic arms and Bluetooth controlled robotic cars.
