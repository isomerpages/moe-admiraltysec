Introduction
------------

An integral part of the Student Development curriculum is the LLP where Admirals are nurtured into Mindful Leaders through Community Outreach. Through this programme, students are equipped with essential lifeskills including ‘The Leadership Challenge’ practices and Design Thinking which are then applied in solving authentic community issues. 21st Century Competencies including Civic Literacy and Cross-cultural skills, Critical and Inventive Thinking as well as Communication, Collaboration and Information skills would be enhanced through this programme.

In Admiralty Secondary School, we believe that every Admiral is a leader and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is an integral part of Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. The programme aims to nurture mindful leaders who are confident, concerned, self-directed and contributing Admirals.

  

The LLP is a 2-tiered programme designed for Admirals to be equipped with, and apply their knowledge and skills in an authentic setting.

  

  

**Tier 1 (All Admirals)**

  

To strengthen the effectiveness of the programmes, our school integrates The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner in our curriculum. The programmes are also in line with the different level outcomes Self/Peer/Team/Thought Leadership) in order to develop them holistically.

Values in Action (VIA) is integrated with the Learning for Life Programme - Nurturing Mindful Leaders through Community Outreach. VIA is an essential learning experience for Admirals to support their holistic development, in particular their socio-emotional competencies. The team aims to bring authentic learning experiences that influence the community positively. This is enabled by our school’s close collaboration with external community organisations. Admirals apply Design Thinking principles to empathise with different groups of the community, and collaborate with peers to make positive and meaningful contributions.

**Tier 2 (Student Leaders)**

  

Our Student Leadership Development programmes are in line with the school’s vision - Values-Centric, Thinking School. There is a need to ground leadership in sound values to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way. At the same time, Admirals’ development of personal and inter-personal skills are also important. These skills enable Admirals to assume responsibilities that serve his/her peers and the community.
