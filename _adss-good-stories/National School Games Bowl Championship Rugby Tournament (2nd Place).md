National School Games Bowl Championship Rugby Tournament \[2nd Place\]
======================================================================

It was a long season - the team played many games, sustained injuries and  players were tired. Nevertheless, the high level of self-discipline and resilience of the players paid off with the team’s achievement.

On the day of the finals, school leaders, teachers, parents, student councillors and students from the Sports CCA gathered at the stadium to cheer the boys on. This was a sight to behold, for the school came together and held the Admiralty flag high with pride.
