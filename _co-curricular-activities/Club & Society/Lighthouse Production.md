**Tagline:  Serving ADSS with pride.**

The Lighthouse Productions (LHP) combines the development of Photography, Videography, and Audio-Visual skills.  This CCA offers the opportunity for students to experience many useful life skills through courses, events and competitions. 

<u>Photography and Videography</u>

Students undergo training by their seniors and professionals - Basic Photography workshop to learn the foundational skills of photography using DSLR cameras, and advanced workshops such as Studio Photography and Photojournalism. LHP students’ commitment to Lifelong Learning and High Expectations can be observed through their works at our public and in-house photography exhibitions. 

Audio Visual

Indoors or outdoors, rain or shine, whenever there is a need for audiovisual support, LHP students are ready to serve the school. This includes the smooth running of the morning assemblies, and ensuring the success of every programme that requires audiovisual support. Through these experiences, LHP students learn the importance of teamwork and communication.  Staying calm under pressure is also what LHP students learn from this CCA.
