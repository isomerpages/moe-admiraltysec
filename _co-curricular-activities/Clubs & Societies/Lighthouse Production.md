Introduction
------------

The Lighthouse Productions (LHP) is a key service provider for school events and assemblies. Indoors or outdoors, rain or shine, whenever there is a need for audiovisual support, LHP students are ready to serve the school. This CCA offers the opportunity for students to experience many useful life skills through organizing activities, relevant training, running school events and participation in competitions. It must provide timely and efficient support for many school events, including assembly programs, Speech days, National Day celebrations, Staff Appreciation Day, Chinese New Year Celebration, Emergency Evacuation exercises and many others. Through these experiences, LHP students learn the importance of teamwork and communication. Staying calm under pressure is also what LHP students learn from this CCA.

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

Basic Photography

Students are introduced to basic photography concepts through lectures and hands-on practice by their seniors and professionals. They learn foundational skills of photography using DSLR cameras, and advanced skills such as Studio Photography and Photojournalism. During the workshop, students work on a personal project, which helps them express themselves visually. Events photography is also regularly incorporated into students’ training through the coverage of school events.

  

Videography

Students learn videography by putting together the videos and photographs which they have taken. They will shoot, edit and present their work, which would be in the form of a video project. Through the workshop, students are equipped with the relevant videography and editing skills. They will combine and edit video clips, add effects, transitions, titles, music, sound effects, and other elements to build a complete and compelling video project. Through these skills, students are more able to confidently shoot and edit videos of performances for school events such as Chinese New Year Celebration, National Day Parade and many more.

Students are trained to set up microphones and importantly control the sound broadcasted to the audience.
