Introduction
------------

ADSS Robotics Club (RC) grows Admirals into robotics enthusiasts who can leverage their creativity and Design Thinking (DT) skills to solve real-world problems. Through participation in local and international competitions, students acquire technological expertise, life skills and exemplify our school’s values. Students in RC are also taught to demonstrate the maker’s spirit, an important 21st century competency.

  

Our CCA aims to develop:

*   confident leaders who lead effectively, work collaboratively with teammates and display sportsmanship
*   passionate learners who apply technology to real-world contexts
*   competent students who engage in problem-solving and develop creative solutions
