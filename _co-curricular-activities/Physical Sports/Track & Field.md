Introduction
------------

**Who we are:**

The Admiralty Secondary School Track and Field Team comprises of dedicated Athletes who see the value of Sports and the discipline it instills in all of us. We offer short, mid and long distance events to our Athletes, catering to their diverse talents and strengths.

  

**What we strive for:**

We strive to build a united team that displays strong sportsmanship and is humble in their sporting journey. We do this by exposing our Athletes to multiple competitions, timed trials and opportunities to organize their off-season training sessions to hone their leadership skills.

  

**What we believe in:**

We believe in the notion of “Train Hard, Race Easy”. Our Athletes give their best during training sessions and competitions.

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

Differentiated Training

We understand that every Athlete is unique. Our differentiated training programme ensures that we cater to the diverse group of Athletes and help them reach their potential. The techniques required for short, mid and long distance vary and the differentiated training ensures that our Athletes master these techniques.

Off-season

During the off-season, we give our Athletes the autonomy to plan and run some of their training and team bonding sessions. This allows our senior Athletes to hone their leadership skills as well as planning skills. Our Athletes also put their values in action by giving back to society. In 2021, we collaborated with Food Bank Singapore in a food donation drive. We believe these opportunities help us develop holistic Athletes.

**Quotes from students**

  

1.  “Throughout my entire experience in the Admiralty Track team, one thing I really enjoy is making new friends and training with them. I prefer training with the team as I get to talk and have fun with them. I have learnt to be more disciplined. Whenever the coach gives us a workout to do, we do it diligently. Another thing I have learnt is to be more proactive in leading my teammates.” - Davina Adrian Pereira

2.  “What I enjoy about CCA is that we are all very bonded. Through the CCA’s training, I have developed resilience and self-discipline. I would promote Track and Field as a CCA as it has a lot of friendly people and the CCA offers you to be independent through the training.” – Sam Zu Yi

3.  “I have learnt how to be more self-disciplined over the years in Track and Field as I do my own training. I have also learnt the proper stretches, workouts and strategies for running. Track and Field offers you the opportunity to showcase your hard work through the competitions which push you to perform at your very best.” - Yong Jun Ping Markcus
