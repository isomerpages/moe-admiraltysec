Introduction
------------

Tagline: Agility, Discipline, Spirit & Sportsmanship

The ADSS badminton team comprises the B and C Division Boys and Girls teams. Every year, the school sends the teams to participate in the Inter-School Zonal Badminton Championship, and infriendly matches with other schools.

Besides the regular trainings, students also engage in activities such as community involvement programmes, and first aid training. These activities contribute to our students’ growth as effective team players and influential leaders who display resilience, sportsmanship, discipline and integrity.

 Our CCA aims to:

* Develop pupils to become sports leaders who are intrinsically motivated and focused on resilience and excellence in their quest for success 

* Equip players with the knowledge, understanding and skills necessary at competitive level.

* Inculcate in students to be self-disciplined, responsible team players and active contributors.

* Develop leadership in the players by providing opportunities and guidance.
