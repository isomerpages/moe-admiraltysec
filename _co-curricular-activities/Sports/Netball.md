ADSS Netball Club comprises female students who have a passion for the game and are committed to improving their playing skills and knowledge. We encourage a competitive drive in our team. At the same time, we emphasise the importance of character development in and out of court.

Our CCA aims to:

*   Equip players with the knowledge, understanding and skills of netball;
*   Develop players who demonstrate excellence, leadership and confidence in and out of court; and
*   Inculcate a spirit of serving the school and the community.
