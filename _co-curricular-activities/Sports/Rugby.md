Rugby at Admiralty emphasises good character and values to develop our students as fine gentlemen who will make themselves and their families, the school and the community proud. 

  

Our CCA aims to (as according to CCA SDP):

*   Develop a passion for the sport  
    
*   Develop each player to be a strong team player  
    
*   Inculcate values to be dynamic leaders
