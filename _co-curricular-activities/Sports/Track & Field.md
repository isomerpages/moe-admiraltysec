Introduction
------------

**Tagline:  Train Hard, Race Easy.**

Admiralty Secondary School’s athletic club comprises students with immense passion in track and field. Athletes have high expectations of themselves at all times. Our athletes are self-directed learners who take charge of their own training and challenge themselves. We train with perseverance and dedication so that we are better than the best we can ever be.

Our CCA aims to:

* Improve our athletes’ fitness, stamina, speed and agility so that they will be proficient to represent our school in athletics events;

* Develop our athletes’ character, values and leadership, as they learn to support and encourage one another; and 

* Encourage athletes to serve and contribute to the school and community through sports.
