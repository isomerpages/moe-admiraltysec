The **MISSION** of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.


The NPCC was formed in 1959. Since its start, it has grown in strength to become one of the popular youth organizations in Singapore. The Admiralty Secondary School unit was established in 2002, the same year when ADSS was established. The unit comprises over 100 hundred cadets from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5.

  

Our CCA aims to:

*   Develop students to be active citizens and community leaders.
*   Develop students who demonstrate confidence, leadership and teamwork.
*   Inculcate a spirit of service to the school community and beyond.
