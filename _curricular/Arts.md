Introduction
------------

Admiralty Secondary School believes in developing the child artistically and connects them with their community and culture. At our school, every Admirals will be exposed to learning different art forms and develop a deep appreciation for the aesthetics.

  

We aim to empower our students with artistic knowledge and skills in aesthetics through quality arts education for expression, learning and reflection.

  

In our art programmes together with Differentiated Learning (D.I.), we aim to nurture our students to be self-directed, confident, creative, contributing and thinking Admirals who are creative, having critical thinking and communication skills and aesthetic sensitivity with cultural awareness.

  

The Art department is committed to increase opportunities for all students to participate in and recognize the value of the Arts in society. The department strives to expose all pupils to appreciating and expressing Art through a variety of platforms. Our aim is for them to become life-long learners who are confident and creative with a passion for life and learning.

  

Through the Arts, pupils are more aware of the values and roles of the Arts in society, thus connecting them to our history, culture and heritage. Pupils also learn to respect the culture, belief systems and values of others and to appreciate the deeper forms of beauty in life.

  

Students are encouraged to explore, to create, and to reach their full potential through our wide variety of arts exposure programmes in school. We believe that the Arts drive creativity and creativity drives learning and when there is learning, students will grow and flourish abundantly.
