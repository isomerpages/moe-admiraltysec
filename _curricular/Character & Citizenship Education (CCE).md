Introduction
------------

CCE is central to Admiralty Secondary School’s vision of a “Values Centric, Thinking School”. The school believes in holistic development of our students to become confident, concerned, self-directed and contributing Admirals. CCE is integrated in our Curricular and Co-Curricular programmes - achieved by inculcating values, building Social Emotional (SE) competencies and developing 21st Century Competencies in our Admirals.

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

The implementation of CCE in ADSS takes reference from the CCE 2021 framework and syllabus.

  

The explicit teaching of values and social and emotional competencies are carried out through the CCE Lessons (LIGHTS lesson) and school-based CCE programmes.

  

The reinforcement of the values and social and emotional competencies is facilitated through the various Admiralty Experience Programmes.

*   Co-curricular Activities (CCA)
*   Student Leadership Development Programme (SLD)
*   Values-in-Action Programme (VIA)
*   Student Development Programme
*   Cohort Experience
*   Citizenship Education Commemoration

  

The learning of CCE is supported by caring and enabling environment, which included positive teacher-student relationship, promoting peer support relationship within class and school, student empowerment through students voices and choices.

  

  

**Citizenship Education**

The citizenship education learning experiences are anchored on the Citizenship Disposition, that will enable our students to develop Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-cultural Skills and function effectively as active citizens who are rooted to Singapore.
