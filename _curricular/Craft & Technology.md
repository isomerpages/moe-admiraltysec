Introduction
------------

**Design & Technology Education**

  

D&T education aims to nurture in our pupils a way of thinking and doing – designerly dispositions which are inherent in design practices – through designing and making. The designerly dispositions are as follows:

*   embracing uncertainties and complexities
*   be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined problems
*   relentless drive to seek out how things work
*   use of doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation.

**Food And Consumer Education/Nutrition Food Science Education**

  

The syllabus is designed to empower students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers; enabling them to better manage their lives for the present and the future. The focus is on how individuals and families optimise their resources of food, finance and time to meet their physical, mental, social and economic needs.

  

The syllabus aims to enable students to:

1.  understand the importance of nutrition for long-term health
2.  apply basic principles of consumer education
3.  apply basic financial principles for everyday decision making and planning
4.  appreciate and develop an understanding of food, nutrition and trans-cultural awareness in the global context
5.  nurture and develop critical thinking, problem-solving and creativity, a spirit of enterprise, innovation, and aesthetic awareness; to make informed and discerning food and consumer-related decisions
6.  develop positive attitudes and values for the well-being of the community (families and society)
7.  demonstrate effective and responsible use of resources for the individuals and the community

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

**Design & Technology**

  

Students experience design through sketching lessons and complete projects based on the ideas they have sketched. Students are encouraged to be creative in their design when they make the projects during the practical sessions. They make cardboard models before completing their designs in wood, metal and plastics.
