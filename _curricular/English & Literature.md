Introduction
------------

With the undeniable importance of the English Language in the 21st century, it is imperative for citizens of the world to be equipped with a high level of proficiency in the use and appreciation of Standard English. As such, in Admiralty Secondary School, we aim to prepare and provide our Admirals with a competitive edge in the employment of the language, both in terms of comprehension and construction of meaning, pivotal in ensuring their success in this ever progressing world.

  

Based on the latest 2020 MOE EL syllabus, the ADSS ELL Department focuses all strategies with the guiding principles of:

1) spiral progression in terms of learning from Secondary 1 to 5,

2) contextualisation of the learning of skills to real-world, authentic situations and issues;

3) learner-centeredness to ensure that students’ learning needs are met, and

4) integration of all skills so that learning is seamless.

  

Through these principles, we hope to achieve the following learner outcomes and values:

Key Strategies adopted by the EL Dept:
--------------------------------------

1.  Annotation of texts, a strategy with a unique ADSS framework, to enhance student understanding of the construction of meaning (semantics) through language devices and the manipulation of linguistic techniques.

2.  Teaching of thinking routines, such as logic flow, to aid student analyses of real-world issues and to allow students to exercise critical and creative thinking skills so that they become mindful of multiple and alternative perspectives in authentic situations.

3.  Teaching of presentation skills including the use of paralinguistic features to help students articulate their ideas and opinions accurately, clearly, confidently and effectively to address a particular purpose, audience, context and culture.
