**Our Mission:** Developing Voyagers to conquer the Sea of Mathematics

  

  

The Mathematics Department adopts a student-centric approach with a focus of instilling a sense of Responsibility and Self Discipline for students taking Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.

  

Students will go through 3 stages in their learning of Mathematics. Firstly, they will be exposed to programmes to promote Awareness and create Interest in the learning of Mathematics through games, use of ICT and performance tasks. Secondly, they will be given ample opportunities to Build Confidence by applying what they learn by taking part in Mathematics competitions like SASMO and Math Competition for Normal Stream. Students are stretched based on their level of preparedness through Subject Based Banding (SBB) and Out of Stream Subject (OOS). Finally, is the stage which involves the building of Rigor in preparing the student for their final goal in preparing for their national examination to achieve their aspirations.

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

**ICT IN CLASSROOM**

Students learn Mathematics through ICT platforms like SLS, Desmo and Geogebra to have a deeper understanding on the Mathematics concepts. There is also E-book available such that students do not need to bring their heavy textbooks to school. They can access the E-book via their Chromebook or Ipad.
