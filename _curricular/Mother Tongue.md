Introduction
------------

_Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire. – W.B. Yeats_

  

Through the provision of a values-based and student-centric learning environment, we grow our students’ interest in and appreciation for the Chinese/Malay language and culture, and motivate them towards excellence in their Mother Tongue Language. As we nurture them to be responsible and active users of their mother tongue, the seed is planted for our students to be learned, future-ready persons who contribute to society.

  

本部门以价值观为本，打造以学生为中心的优越学习环境，培养学生对母语和华族/马来族文化的兴趣，进而激发他们投入到母语的学习里。本部门也力求灌输学生正确的传统价值观，让他们了解并珍惜本族文化。毕业自美雅中学的学生，会是能善用母语，有责任感，并能面向未来，贡献社会的好公民。

  

Melalui suasana pengajaran dan pembelajaran berteraskan nilai, kami berharap dapat menyemai minat dan cinta pelajar terhadap bahasa dan budaya Melayu. Dalam masa yang sama juga, merangsang mereka meraih kecemerlangan dalam Bahasa Melayu. Kami juga berhasrat agar dapat memupuk penghayatan dan pemikiran nilai-nilai murni yang menjadi asas budaya kita kepada pelajar. Diharap melalui pendidikan nilai-nilai ini, mereka menjadi pengguna yang bertanggungjawab dan aktif menggunakan Bahasa Melayu serta sentiasa bersedia menyumbang kepada masyarakat pada masa hadapan demi menyahut seruan visi Arif Budiman.

Programmes and Outcomes
-----------------------

_Ask ‘How will they learn best?’ not ‘Can they learn?’ – J. Escalante_

  

At Admiralty Secondary School, using Design Thinking, Mother Tongue Language teaching and learning is meaningfully designed to cater to the profiles and needs of our students.

  

*   **Customised teaching and learning** \- Learning is pitched at each student’s ability by teachers with relevant expertise. Contemporary issues are often discussed to engage students and deepen their understanding of the world around them. Higher ability students will have the opportunity to offer Higher Mother Tongue Language and Literature in Malay (Elective). Students who require more support will learn at an appropriate pace with customised materials.

*   **Authentic learning** \- Cultural exposure via learning journeys and overseas cultural immersion offer students real-life exposure to the use of their mother tongue and enhance their appreciation for the language and culture.

*   **Integration of ICT** \- The use of ICT is prevalent for greater relevance to students’ life and future, as well as to offer immediate feedback on students’ learning progress.

  

_“Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” – J. Dewey_

They also develop their 21st Century Competencies in global awareness, and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.
