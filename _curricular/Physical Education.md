Introduction
------------

Admiralty Secondary School’s Physical Education (PE) Department believes that physical education plays a vital role in the holistic education and character development of our Admirals. With the adoption of the Holistic Health Framework (HHF) for the school’s wellness programme, the department is better focused on developing the total well-being of each Admirals. There is now greater emphasis by the teachers to promote and enhance physical, mental as well as social health. In this way, students will learn to develop skills and attitudes to live healthily and sustain a healthy lifestyle even after they graduate from school.

  

In Admiralty, we strive to make PE a meaningful and engaging experience for students to develop their psychomotor, cognitive, and social skills.
