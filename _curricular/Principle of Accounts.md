Introduction
------------

Principles of Accounts (POA) is a subject offered to Secondary 3 and 4 students. The O-Level and N(A)-Level Principles of Accounts syllabuses (codes 7087 and 7086 respectively) seek to develop in students the knowledge and skills to prepare, communicate and use both accounting and non-accounting information related to the business for decision-making.

*   learn to be organised and structured when they consolidate information into financial statements used by stakeholders for decision-making

*   develop 21st century competencies especially critical thinking and communication skills when they analyse information, make decisions based on it and present their decisions.

*   acquire transferrable skills such as organising and analysing information for decision-making and apply these skills in their daily lives.
