20th Anniversary Speech Day
===========================

The 20th Speech Day was held on 4 March to celebrate the achievements of our staff and students using a hybrid model, face-to-face in the school hall, and livestreamed to students in classes. The event was graced by past school leaders as well as representatives of the School Advisory Committee and Parent Support Group. Our uniform groups and Concert Band came together to put up a mass display that demonstrated Admirals’ love and appreciation for the school as a second home. The Modern Dance Club members expressed their hope for the school to grow stronger and shine brighter. Together, the school looks forward to more years of LIGHTS.
