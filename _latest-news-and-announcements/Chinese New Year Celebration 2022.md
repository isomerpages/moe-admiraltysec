Chinese New Year Celebration 2022
=================================

The Chinese New Year (CNY) celebration was held on Monday, 31 January 2022. To start the celebrations, students viewed a video montage that showed Â wonderful performances by fellow Admirals and how different countries celebrate CNY. From this, Admirals understood the significance of the beginning of spring in various countries. Within the video montage, there were two hidden codes and Admirals had to break the code in order to win a prize. Prizes were given to each level for the classes with the correct answers within the fastest time. As a finale, students folded tiger origami for decoration to signify the Year of the Tiger.
