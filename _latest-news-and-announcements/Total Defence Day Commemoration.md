Total Defence Day Commemoration
===============================

Total Defence Day was commemorated on 8 February 2022. This year, along with safe distancing measures, Admirals had an informative and enjoyable experience learning about the 6 pillars of defence. With the emergence of cyber crime, this year’s commemoration focused on the 6th pillar – Digital Defence! Admirals also had a great time decorating their logo of Total Defence and apply practical skills such as basic first-aid and CPR.
