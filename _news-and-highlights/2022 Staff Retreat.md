After a hiatus of 2 years due to the pandemic, all staff finally managed to embark on a staff retreat to take stock and learn new skills with each other’s company.

To increase awareness of staff on the post-secondary landscape and exposure to different cuisines, all staff went on a learning journey to At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy where they learnt to cook different three course meals. In addition, staff also had the opportunity to identify various herbs. It was a fun-filled day for all staff as they filled their stomachs with their own cooking, as the school recognised all who had contributed to the great year we had!
