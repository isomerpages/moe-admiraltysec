### Chinese New Year Celebration 2023

This year, we celebrated Chinese New Year like never before! On 20 January 2023, the school gathered in the hall to enjoy our inaugural CNY Concert after a two-year hiatus. The atmosphere was electrifying when our Guzheng Ensemble students performed two pieces of traditional Chinese music, followed by a surprise visit from Cai Shen Ye (God of Wealth) and the princess.

Drama Club students presented a skit demonstrating Chinese New Year customs and traditions, further enriching our understanding of the Chinese culture. Everyone participated in the quiz to gain more insights about CNY customs and gained immense appreciation of its meaningfulness.

The concert reached an astounding high when Wushu students and Mr Tan Yuan Yan gave an impressive demonstration of agility and grace. The performance by the Dance CCA made all eyes hooked on their elegant movements.    

Finally, everyone sang traditional CNY songs such as Gong Xi Gong Xi and Chun Lian Hong, ending the celebration on a happy and high note! It was an incredibly joyous morning spent together as one Admiralty family, ushering in the fantastic Year of the Rabbit.
