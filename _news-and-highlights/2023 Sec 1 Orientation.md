### 2023 Secondary 1 Orientation

Our Secondary 1 Admirals embarked on their Admiralty Experience with a 4-day Orientation Programme from 3 to 6 Jan 2023. Admirals were engaged in the icebreaker activities, and team-bonding games facilitated by Student Leaders and form teachers. Our Sec 1 Admirals participated enthusiastically in the school tour and CCA Experience, where experiential learning, games, and quizzes were incorporated. The highlight of the orientation programme was the “Orion Aspirational Activity”, where students presented their class’s shared vision through their class cheers. These activities provided opportunities for students to build rapport among peers and teachers, make a transition into secondary school life, and discover their interests and strengths!
