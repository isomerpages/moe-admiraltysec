<p>This year, ADSS goes to RWS for our staff retreat, where we took some
time to know more about what we want in the school and get to know each
other better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADSS staff retreat took place on 17 November 2023 at RWS.&nbsp; The staff
retreat involved all school leaders, teachers, and members of our school
admin team. We took some time in the morning to take stock and think about
where we want to be headed.&nbsp; The morning session saw all staff actively
engaging in discussion as we envision 2030 together.&nbsp; In the afternoon,
through a simple team-bonding activity in RWS and SEAA, we got to have
some fun together and know each other better in the process.</p>
