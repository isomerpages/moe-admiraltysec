<p><u>Brief History of NRPC</u>
</p>
<p>Admiralty Secondary School started National Robopreneur Carnival (NRPC)
in 2007. The event aims to challenge young minds by stretching their potential
in STEM and providing them an opportunity to exhibit their enterprising
skills. In 2009, Nanyang Polytechnic come onboard to co-organise this meaningful
competition. In 2019, we updated NRPC to National Robotics Programming
Competition to better reflect the coding and computational.</p>
