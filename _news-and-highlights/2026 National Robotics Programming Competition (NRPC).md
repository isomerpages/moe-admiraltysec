<p>NRPC aims to challenge young minds by stretching their potential in STEM
and providing them an opportunity to develop skills such as problem solving, computational thinking, creative thinking and team spirit.
Admiralty Secondary School started National Robopreneur Carnival (NRPC)
in 2007. In 2009, Nanyang Polytechnic came onboard to co-organise this
meaningful competition. In 2017, we updated NRPC to National Robotics Programming
Competition to better reflect the coding and computational thinking aspect.
The competition took a 2 year break in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID and transited
to online format in 2022 offering only to primary schools. In 2026, NRPC is open to both primary and secondary schools, with Admiralty Secondary School and Nanyang Polytechnic helming the respective categories.</p>
