### International Friendship Day 2023

International Friendship Day took place on 20 April 2023. The vendor, Play_Inc put up a skit entitled “Embrace Diversity”, which was interspersed with interactive games. Embracing the theme of “Singapore in Asia”, it was stressed that international cooperation remains key in our complex world. Asia is the world's fastest-growing region, and Singapore continues to facilitate closer economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and in Asia. By recognising the importance of inter-connectedness between our neighbouring countries, our youth can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, and celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy which promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration. With a deeper understanding of Singapore's realities as a small state and appreciating how we can safeguard our national interest, we have much to contribute to efforts in international cooperation.
