###  **Sec 1 Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Camp 2023

The 4D3N OAL Camp was held at Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre from 10 to 13 July 2023 for all Sec 1 Admirals. Using the outdoors as “classroom” for student learning and character development, Sec 1 Admirals developed their social-emotional competencies, forged camaraderie among themselves and understood the importance of caring for the environment. Various activities held at the camp, such as the journey trail (coastal exploration), team building activities, and outdoor living skills, provided opportunities for students to exercise agency and develop competence while collaborating with others. Resilience and teamwork were key values displayed as the students worked together in groups to overcome challenges.
