### Secondary 2 Cohort Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore

Our Sec 2 Admirals visited the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) to learn about Singapore’s historical journey to nationhood. From a modest fishing village to a thriving cosmopolitan country, Singapore and its people had to overcome many challenges and seize every opportunity for Singapore’s growth. Throughout the exploration of NMS, Admirals had the chance to interact with museum educators to gain deeper insights into the lives of our pioneers, the adversity they faced and sacrifices made for Singapore. It was an eye-opening experience for Admirals indeed!
