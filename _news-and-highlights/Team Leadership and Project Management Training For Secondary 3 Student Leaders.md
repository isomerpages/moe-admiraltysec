###  Secondary 3 Student Leaders Training

The newly minted Secondary 3 Student Leaders, comprising Student Councillors and CCA Leaders, attended the Team Leadership and Project Management Training on 30 May 2023 as part of their leadership journey. This training aimed to equip them with quintessential skills to aid them in their planning of upcoming school programmes such as Racial Harmony Day, National Day and Staff Appreciation Day. The training also focused on strengthening student leadersâ€™ leadership skills based on The Leadership Challenge (TLC) practices that our school has integrated into the curriculum.
