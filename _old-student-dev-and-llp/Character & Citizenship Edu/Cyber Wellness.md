Introduction
------------

Our focus is on guiding students to become responsible digital learners, especially in ADSS where all Admirals own an iPad for learning. As Admirals navigate cyberspace, they should demonstrate respect for self and others, and practise safe and responsible use. Admirals should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.

**MOE Cyber Wellness (CW) Framework**

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘**Respect for Self and Others**’, ‘**Safe and Responsible Use**’ and ‘**Positive Peer Influence**’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

Based on the 4As of Awareness, Appreciation, Action and Advocacy, CW in ADSS takes on a whole-school approach as each level focuses on different themes (e.g.,online safety, being a positive influence online). Up-to-date and relevant, real-world problems and situations are infused into the lessons to make them  more engaging for Admirals. Conducted by form teachers during CCE lessons, everyone plays a crucial role to develop Admirals’ cyber wellness literacy.

A CW booth coinciding with the International Friendship Day (IFD) week of activities was set up during recess on 23 April 2019. The theme this year was “Connected Community”.
