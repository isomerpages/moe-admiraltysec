All students’ devices are installed with the MOE Device Management Application (DMA) as part of the measures to enable a safe and conducive learning environment for students. The purpose of the MOE DMA is to:

*   Keep your child safe online by blocking off undesirable websites
*   Allow parents to be aware of their childrens’ activities on their childrens’ devices
*   Limit screen time for your child, when necessary
