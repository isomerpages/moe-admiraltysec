### Introduction
> "If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher."
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

Indeed, it takes a village to raise a child. Yet, the village cannot do without a strong partnership between the parents and teachers of the child. With the belief that every parent is a supportive partner, the Parent Support Group of Admiralty Secondary School was formed to strengthen the school's effort in fostering closer ties between school and home.

The Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed with the aim of benefiting our Admirals through a strong home school partnership. The School Leaders and the School Management Committee recognise parents’ involvement in making school life more vibrant, caring and a safe place for the students to learn. The PSG complements the school by aligning their objectives with the school’s directions. Through PSG involvement, the School Leaders, staff and parents come together to understand and discuss school initiatives and programmes with a unified goal of improving students’ learning and well-being.
