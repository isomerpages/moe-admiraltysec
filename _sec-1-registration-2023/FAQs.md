##### <u>**PDLP Matters**</u>
**Ms Diyana Jumahat (Email address: diyana_jumahat@moe.edu.sg)**

**1. What is the PLD model prescribed by the school?**
<br>
The school prescribes to the usage of Chromebook and the specific model of the Chromebook will be provided at a later date. The cost of the Chromebook is approximately $550 - $600 (including GST) with a 3-year warranty and insurance.

**2. Can I pay for the PLD using my child’s Edusave Account?**
<br>
Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of their miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. For students requiring financial assistance, further subsidies can be provided by MOE so that they do not have to incur any out-of-pocket expenses.

**3. Why is the warranty 3 years and not 4 years? Can I extend the warranty?**
<br>
Extended warranty beyond 3 years for the computing devices is not available in the open market. It would be very costly to incorporate such requirement and it makes more economical sense to replace the device when it is beyond economical repair after 3 years.

**4. Can my child opt not to purchase the Personal Learning Device (PLD)?**
<br>
Every student is required to have a PLD for teaching and learning purposes. We strongly encourage students to own the PLD model prescribed by the school to ensure a smooth learning experience.

**5. My child already has a learning device. If this can be used, do we need to buy new ones?**
<br>
We strongly encourage students to own the PLD model prescribed by the school to ensure a smooth learning experience. For students who wish to use their own devices, these devices must meet the necessary specifications such as processor speed and compatibility with the school’s Device Management Application (DMA). Please have your child bring the learning device to school and pass it to the General Office. We will check the suitability of the device for learning and advise accordingly thereafter.

**6. Can my child share one PLD with their siblings?**
<br>
For a smooth learning experience, it is strongly encouraged that each student has his/her own device as prescribed by the school. This is because different schools may tap on specific devices for teaching and learning. In addition, the student will be required to use the devices in school daily and for their learning after school, hence it might not be practical to share the device with their siblings.

**7. When will my child receive the PLD after placing an order?**
<br>
The estimated delivery date will be between March and April 2024. Teachers will be cognisant of this timeline and ensure teaching and learning with PLD will only take place after students have received their PLD.

**8. What is the Device Management Application (DMA)?**
<br>

It is a security and management software that is installed in all students’ PLDs. It comprises the following three services:

i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile Device Management Service (facilitates remote deployment of teaching and learning applications and security patches)

ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Management Service (actively controls and monitors students’ use of PLD during lesson time to ensure effective teaching and learning)

iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage Management Service (monitor students’ usage and screen time to address cyber wellness concerns)

**9. Can I choose not to install the DMA in my child’s PLD?**
<br>
The DMA supports you and the school in managing your child’s PLD usage to ensure a meaningful digital learning experience for your child. As such, all PLDs need to be installed with the DMA before they can be used in school for teaching and learning purposes. PLD that is not installed with the DMA will not be allowed for use in school.

**10. Is the DMA enforced 24/7?**
<br>
While the DMA is installed in all PLDs, school will only enforce control during school hours as follows:

Mon – Thu: 0700h – 1500h
<br>
Fri: 0700h – 1300h&nbsp;
<br>
DMA control will not be enforced during weekends, public holidays and school vacation periods.
