##### **CCA Prospectus 2025**

Education at Admiralty Secondary School (ADSS) aims to provide students with a holistic education that will provide opportunities for each student to explore and be developed in the special areas that will allow him/her to grow as a whole person. Apart from the core academic work and the enrichment activities, ADSS offers a range of co-curricular activities (CCAs) that cater to the studentsâ€™ varied interests and capabilities.

This prospectus aims to provide reference for new students of ADSS and to help them decide which CCA is suitable for them. It is intended to guide the student to understand what is involved in each CCA, whether it will suit him/her and the likely commitment called for.
