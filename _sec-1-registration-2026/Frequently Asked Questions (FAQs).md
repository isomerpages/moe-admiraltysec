<p><strong>Can students go overseas for vacation during the school term?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Students should attend school during the school term to benefit fully
from the learning experiences planned by teachers for their holistic development.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are there lockers in school available for rental?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>While the school does not offer lockers for rental, our timetables are
designed with students’ well-bring in mind. Subjects are timetabled such
that students do not need to bring excessive materials to school each day.
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>Where can I find a copy of the class timetable?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>A printed copy of the timetable will be given to students on the first
day of school. A copy will also be uploaded on our school’s website under
“Students”. The timetable may be refreshed at the start of Term 1, 2 and
3. This is to cater to the learning needs of the cohort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Are students allowed to bring mobile phones to school?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Students may bring their mobile phones to school, but they must place
them in their assigned mobile phone lockers upon arrival and ensure they
are locked in before<strong> </strong>morning assembly begins at 8.00am.
The phones should remain in the lockers throughout the entire school day,
including lesson time, CCAs, learning journeys, and any other school-related
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Students may only retrieve their phones after their final curriculum activity
for the day, just before leaving school. This helps maintain a focused
learning environment and ensures the safety of personal belongings.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>CCA Matters</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Can students join more than one CCA?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Students may join more than one CCA provided there are no clashes in the
CCA schedules, and they are able to manage the demands of schoolwork.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>PDLP Matters</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Can I pay for the PLD using my child's Edusave Account?</strong>
<br>
<br>Students who are Singapore Citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of their
miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the
PLD. For students requiring financial assistance, further subsidies can
be provided by MOE so that they do not have to incur any out-of-pocket
expenses.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Can my child opt not to purchase the Personal Learning Device (PLD)?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Every student is required to have a PLD for teaching and learning purposes.
We strongly encourage students to own the PLD model prescribed by the school
to ensure a smooth learning experience.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>My child already has a learning device. If this can be used, do we need to buy new ones?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>We strongly encourage students to own the PLD model prescribed by the
school to ensure a smooth learning experience. For students who wish to
use their own devices, these devices must meet the necessary specifications
such as processor speed and compatibility with the school’s Device Management
Application (DMA). Please have your child bring the learning device to
school and pass it to the General Office. We will check the suitability
of the device for learning and advise accordingly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>When will my child receive the PLD after placing an order?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The estimated delivery date will be between March and April 2026. Teachers
will be cognisant of this timeline and ensure teaching and learning with
PLD will only take place after students have received their PLD.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>What is the Device Management Application (DMA)?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>It is a security and management software that is installed in all students’
PLDs. It comprises the following three services:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mobile Device Management Service (facilitates remote deployment of teaching
and learning applications and security patches)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Classroom Management Service (actively controls and monitors students’
use of PLD during lesson time to ensure effective teaching and learning)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Usage Management Service (monitor students’ usage and screen time to address
cyber wellness concerns)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p><strong>Can I choose not to install the DMA in my child’s PLD?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The DMA supports you and the school in managing your child’s PLD usage
to ensure a meaningful digital learning experience for your child. As such,
all PLDs need to be installed with the DMA before they can be used in school
for teaching and learning purposes. PLD that is not installed with the
DMA will not be allowed for use in school.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>Is the DMA enforced 24/7?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>While the DMA is installed in all PLDs, school will only enforce control
during school hours as follows:&nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Mon – Thu:</strong> 0700 hrs – 1500 hrs&nbsp;
<br><strong>Fri:</strong> 0700 hrs – 1300 hrs &nbsp;
<br>
<br>DMA control will not be enforced during weekends, public holidays and
school vacation periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Is there parental control function in the DMA?</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Yes, there is parental control function in DMA. Parents will be able to
manage this control to control your child’s screen time at home, filter
contents and monitor their online activities and usage. More information
will be shared at a later date.</p>
