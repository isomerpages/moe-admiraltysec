<p><strong><u>Training sessions for CCAs&nbsp;</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>CCAs sessions are conducted&nbsp;<strong> on Mondays and/or Wednesdays after school.</strong> The
duration of the session is dependent on each CCA. More information on each
CCA can be obtained during the CCA Experience which will take place throughout
January 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>CCA Prospectus 2026</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>Education at Admiralty Secondary School (ADSS) aims to provide students
with a holistic education that will provide opportunities for each student
to explore and be developed in the special areas that will allow him/her
to grow as a whole person. Apart from the core academic work and the enrichment
activities, ADSS offers a range of co-curricular activities (CCAs) that
cater to the students’ varied interests and capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prospectus aims to provide reference for new students of ADSS and
to help them decide which CCA is suitable for them. It is intended to guide
the student to understand what is involved in each CCA, whether it will
suit him/her and the likely commitment called for.&nbsp;</p>
