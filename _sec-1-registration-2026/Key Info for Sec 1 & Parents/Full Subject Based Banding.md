<p>All Secondary 1 Admirals will benefit from Full Subject-Based Banding
(Full SBB), which is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of
learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths
and interests of our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Full SBB, students learn each subject at the level that best caters
to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. Students will
begin their secondary school education in mixed form classes, where they
can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students may offer English Language, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics,
Science and Humanities at G3, G2 or G1 levels. Other subjects such as Art,
Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music will be offered
as an accompanying set of Common Curriculum subjects at lower secondary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of secondary school, students will sit for the Singapore-Cambridge
Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations. MOE has reviewed the
admissions criteria for post-secondary pathways to recognise a wider profile
of learners and provide students with more options, while ensuring students
have the necessary fundamentals to thrive in their chosen pathway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>FAQs&nbsp;</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How does Full SBB affect the subjects that students can take at Secondary One?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, students may offer PSLE subjects at a more
demanding level based on their individual Achievement Level (AL) score.
For example, if your child is in Posting Group (PG) 2 but did well in a
subject, (s)he might be offered a chance to take that subject at the G3
level.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Can students choose not to take subjects at a more demanding level?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes. However, we would encourage students to consider how they can benefit
from the opportunity, which can allow them to nurture their strengths and
deepen their engagement in their learning. The opportunity may also allow
access to more post-secondary pathways. For more information on post-secondary
pathways, please see <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/faq.html#changes-to-post-secondary-admissions</u></a> and

</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>If students choose not to take subjects at a more demanding level at Secondary 1, will they be given opportunities to take the same subject(s) at a more demanding level subsequently?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may offer subjects at
a more demanding level subsequently, based on their performance in the
subject and a holistic assessment by the school to ensure that the student
can cope with the subject and overall workload. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, these students would miss out on content that was covered, and
be required to attend bridging lessons to close learning gaps. As such,
we encourage students to take subjects at more demanding levels as early
as possible. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>What if students do not cope well with taking subject(s) at a more demanding level? Can they opt out and take the subject(s) at a less demanding level?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Students are encouraged to continue taking the subjects at a more demanding
level until the end of Secondary 2, given that students need time to adjust
to both secondary school life and to the more demanding subject. The school
will provide learning support to all students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before a decision is made to recalibrate subject levels, students should
seek advice from subject teachers, and consider any impact on post-secondary
pathways.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Can students opt to take Mother Tongue Language (MTL) at less demanding levels?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Bilingual policy is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education. Under
our bilingual policy, all students are required to offer English and a
MTL. Students in mainstream schools are required to offer a MTL subject
and sit for the national examination at the end of secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the child has reasons (e.g., special educational needs) that may impede
his/her ability to do MTL, parents may submit application for MTL exemption
to Ministry of Education through the school. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p><strong>My child received MOE approval to offer Foreign Language (FL) or Asian Language (AsL) in lieu of an official MTL (not as 3rd language) in primary school. Do I need to re-apply for approval?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You are not required to re-apply for approval. However, you will need
to make private study arrangements for your child and ensure that your
private education provider can prepare your child for the national examinations
at the end of secondary school.&nbsp;
