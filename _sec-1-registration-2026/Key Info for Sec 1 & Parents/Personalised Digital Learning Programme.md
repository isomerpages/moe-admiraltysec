<h4><strong><u>Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)</u></strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020
for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national elearning platform -
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) - as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Choice of PLD in Admiralty Secondary School</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>The school is using the <strong>Acer Chromebook R857TN </strong>(8GB RAM
and 64GB) as its choice for the PLD for all students. The device bundle
includes a 4-year warranty and 4-year insurance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that parents/guardians <strong>do not </strong>have the option
to select a different PLD or accessory for school purchase. All students
are required to purchase the same device bundle at ADSS, as per MOE guidelines.</p>
