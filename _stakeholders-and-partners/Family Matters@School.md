Family Matters@School
=====================

<p style="line-height: 19.6px;"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p> 
  
The Family Matters@School (FMS) is supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to provide parents with access to family life programmes that enable them to better connect with their children.

We aim to equip parents with effective parenting skills - eventually training them to be parent facilitators, trainings for school staff to enhance their family life, and life skills and character building training for students.
