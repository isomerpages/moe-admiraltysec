"If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher." 

A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

  

Indeed it takes a village to raise a child. Yet, the village cannot do without a strong partnership between the parents and teachers of the child. With the belief that every parent is a supportive partner, the Parent Support Group of Admiralty Secondary School was formed to strengthen the school's effort in fostering closer ties between school and home. 

The objectives of the PSG are as follows:

*   To provide a platform for parents to be involved in their children's education process
*   To enhance parent-teacher partnership in areas planned for their children
*   To gather support and reinforcement on school's activities
*   To tap on the expertise of the parents in areas that they can help in
*   To enable parents to be role models for the students
*   To attract other parents to be involved in the school

In addition, PSG also provides a platform for parents to voice out their opinions and ideas about the school, for the school and through the school.

We hope that all parents can come forward and contribute to the holistic development of our students.  
Come and join us!
