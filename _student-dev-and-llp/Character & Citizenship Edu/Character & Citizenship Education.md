Introduction
------------

(CCE is central to Admiralty Secondary School’s vision of a “Values Centric, Thinking School”. The school believes in holistic development of our students to become confident, concerned, self-directed and contributing Admirals. CCE is integrated in our Curricular and Co-Curricular programmes - achieved by inculcating values, building Social Emotional (SE) competencies and developing 21st Century Competencies in our Admirals.
