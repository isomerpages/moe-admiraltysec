Programmes
----------

**Professionals sharing and booths by PSEI**

Objectives:

*   To improve Admirals’ understanding of the jobs available in the market; and   
    
*   To develop understanding of wide range of courses available at PSEI

As part of the upper secondary level programmes and education career guidance, ADSS invited 15 professionals to share about their job scopes and career prospects of the industry. A wide range of professionals were invited, including marketing experts from Grab, front desk manager from St Regis Singapore, and an gym-instructor turned entrepreneur. The personal and candid sharing by these professionals introduced Admirals to the wide range of careers available to them after graduating from secondary school.

In addition, all five polytechnics and the ITE set up booths at the foyer for Admirals to find out more about the courses available at their institutions. They also interacted with students from these institutions to learn more about life as a tertiary student.
