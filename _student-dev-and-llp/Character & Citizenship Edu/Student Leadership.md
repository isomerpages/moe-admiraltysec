Introduction
------------

In Admiralty Secondary School, we believe that effective and mindful leaders can be nurtured. As such, the development of students’ leadership competencies is intentional. We also believe that every student has the potential to be developed as a leader and will be given an opportunity to showcase their leadership skills.

Our Student Leadership Development programmes are in line with the school’s vision - Values-Centric, Thinking School. There is a need to ground leadership in sound values to enable student leaders to lead others to achieve goals in an ethical way. At the same time, Admirals’ development of personal and inter-personal skills are also important. These skills enable Admirals to assume responsibilities that serve his/her peers and the community.

To strengthen the effectiveness of the programmes, our school integrates The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner in our curriculum. The programmes are also in line with the different level outcomes (Self/Peer/Team/Thought Leadership) in order to develop them holistically.
