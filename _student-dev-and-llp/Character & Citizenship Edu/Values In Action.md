Introduction
------------

In Admiralty Secondary School, Values in Action (VIA) is integrated with the Learning for Life Programme - Nurturing Mindful Leaders through Community Outreach. VIA is an essential learning experience for Admirals to support their holistic development, in particular their socio-emotional competencies. The team aims to bring authentic learning experiences that influence the community positively. This is enabled by our school’s close collaboration with external community organisations. Admirals apply Design Thinking principles to empathise with different groups of the community, and collaborate with peers to make positive and meaningful contributions.
