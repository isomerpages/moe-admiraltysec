Introduction
------------

At Secondary 2, the focus of our programmes is to build Admirals’ competencies in relationship management, civic consciousness and social responsibility. This is an important year of growth – preparation to take on leadership roles in CCA and development of clarity of personal aspirations to inform subject choices for upper secondary level.

Programmes
----------
<p style="line-height: 19.6px;"><b><u>Overseas Cultural Immersion Programme</u></b></p>

This annual overseas cultural immersion programme seeks to develop Admirals’ global awareness and cross-cultural skills. Through the heritage tours, Admirals will observe how History in their textbooks come alive, and appreciate the culture and heritage of Malaysia. The school immersion will also enable Admirals to interact with local students over two days, and experience the life of a student in Malaysia.

In 2019, the school embarked on its inaugural trip to Penang, and previous cohorts had visited Malacca.
