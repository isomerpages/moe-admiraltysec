Introduction
------------

Secondary 4 & 5 are crucial years for Admirals as they prepare for the national examinations and the next phase of tertiary education. With strong guidance, constant motivation and equipped with essential skills, graduating Admirals are ready to actualise their aspirations. Our programmes which span across the cognitive, aesthetic, moral, physical and social domains, will develop Admirals into confident, concerned, self-directed and contributing individuals.

Programmes
----------

As part of ADSS Co-Curriculum, the Secondary 4 & 5 programmes aim to provide  

*   Age-appropriate exposure and development to Secondary 4 & 5 students in the CLAMPS (Cognitive, Leadership, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social) domains and
    
*   Experiential opportunities for Secondary 4 & 5 students to develop the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes for the 21st century.   
    

**Dream Actualisation Retreat Programme (DARe Programme)**

The DARe Programme supports Secondary 4 & 5 Admirals in preparation for their national examinations. It guides them to discover their aspirations; and navigate the diverse education and industry landscape.

As one of the final cohort programmes in their years at ADSS, we hope that the DARe programme will leave fond memories of the school. The DARe Programme comprises:

*   Motivation and Revision Skills Workshop
    
*   Career exploration through sharing by Professionals and booths by Institutes of Higher Learning  
    
*   Archery and Target Setting  
    
*   Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) Workshop
