Student Development
===================

**‘Every Admiral, a Leader’**

Admiralty Secondary School believes that every child is a leader. This is characterised by the four desired outcomes of Confident, Self-directed, Concerned and Contributing Admiral, and anchored firmly in the school values (LIGHTS). 

Admirals are empowered to actualise their aspirations through the values-based Student Development curriculum, structures and processes. A focus on the development of Admirals’ Social and Emotional Competencies, 21st Century Competencies, Practices from ‘The Leadership Challenge’ and Design Thinking ensures that Admirals aredeveloped holistically across the Cognitive, Leadership, Aesthetics, Moral, Physical and Social (CLAMPS) domains. This is done in a progressive and integrated manner over their time with the school. 

We believe that quality relationships between teachers and students, and amongst peers are also important. In line with the school’s Culture of Care and Culture of Learning, the school has adopted a restorative and relational approach to student management to ensure every child is well-supported by the Student development Team (SDT). 

To nurture Character and Citizenship in Admirals and strengthen their self-efficacy and motivation to succeed, students are taught strategies for self-leadership and how they can enhance their internal locus of control.  At the same time, we encourage students’ voices to be heard, and involve them actively in organizing school-wide and community activities. This will nurture Admirals with the heart to serve and promote a strong school identity, thereby, rootedness to Singapore.
