2022 School Reopening
=====================

Dear Admirals,  
  

A brand new school year will be starting soon.   

The school would like to remind you of the followings when you come back to school on **4 Jan, Tuesday**.

They are: 

1. Report to school by **7.15am** in full school uniform and in proper grooming. Secondary 1 students who have not purchased their uniforms may report in their primary school uniform.

2. Proceed directly to your classrooms upon arrival in school.

3. Wear your mask properly at all times. Please bring along extra pieces of masks.

4. Bring a working oral thermometer (ODT). All Sec 1 students will be issued with a new thermometer on the first day of school.

5. Secondary 2 to 5 students are to bring your fully charged Personal Learning Devices.

6. Practice safe distancing from others at all times.

7. The staggered dismissal timing for 4th January 2022 will be as follows:

> a. Secondary 1: 2.10pm
> 
> b. Secondary 3: 2.15pm

We look forward to welcoming you back!  

However, for students who are unwell, do stay at home and see a doctor. At the same time, inform your Form Teachers or call the general office.  

Let’s stay safe - Do what is needed to protect not only yourself, but your family, your friends, and everyone around you.
