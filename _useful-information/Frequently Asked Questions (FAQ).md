Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

**Co-Curricular Activities (CCA):**

**1.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What are the CCAs offered in Admiralty Secondary School?**

Admiralty Secondary offers 16 CCAs across the categories - Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups, Clubs and Societies, and Visual and Performing Arts.

Learn more about the CCAs at Admiralty Secondary at:&nbsp;**[/student-development-n-learning-for-life-program/co-curricular-activities-cca]**(https://moe-admiraltysec-staging.netlify.app/art-and-environment-club/co-curricular-activities/club-and-society/permalink)  
  

**2.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**When are CCAs conducted?**

CCAs are conducted on Wednesdays. Students are required to report to their respective CCAs by 3.00 pm. No students will be allowed to leave the school compound unless written permission has been obtained from the CCA teachers/Head of Department PE &amp; CCA/School Leaders.

Some CCAs may conduct a second session on Friday. This will be stated in the termly/semestral CCA training schedule issued at the start of each term/semester. CCAs preparing intensively for competitions may conduct a third session on non-CCA days.

In the event whereby a CCA session needs to be cancelled, CCA teachers will inform parents through a notification letter or telephone call.  
  

&nbsp;**3.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Can students join more than one CCA?**

As all CCAs run concurrently every Wednesday, it is not recommended for students to join more than one CCA. This ensures that students have full experiences from their CCA.

That said, special considerations can be made for a student who displays talents in certain areas. This is on a case-by-case basis, and needs to be approved by the school.  
  

&nbsp;**4.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**How is the CCA allocation done?**

Students are allocated CCAs based on their choice, strengths, and interests. However, due to limited resources (venue, logistic, coaches/instructors etc), and vacancies, we may not be able to cater to the interest of all students.

In the interest of student well-being, the school also takes into account students’ physical/medical conditions during allocation of CCAs.

  

**5.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Can my child change his/her CCA after the allocation?**

We strongly encourage students to stay in the same CCA as CCA plays a key role in their holistic development. With sustained participation in a CCA, students will progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes which CCA programmes have been planned for.

In LEAPS 2.0, students are recognised for obtaining at least 75% attendance in the same CCA for 4/5 years. That said, students will not be penalised if they were to change CCA for valid reasons.

Any change of CCA will be assessed on a case-by case-basis. Requests for a change can only be made at the beginning of each academic year through the HOD/PE &amp; CCA. Students are expected to continue attending the current CCA until official notification of a change in CCA.

**Sexuality Education**

**6.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is taught during Sexuality Education lessons?**

Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand their physiological, social and emotional changes as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

In Admiralty Secondary School, Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;[here](https://admiraltysec.moe.edu.sg/useful-information/moe-sexuality-education)&nbsp;for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.

  

**Cyberwellness**

**7.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**How does ADSS support students’ cyberwellness, and in understanding how to use mobile devices in a responsible manner?**

Students are supported through lessons on Cyber Wellness which are infused into our school’s Character and Citizenship (CCE) curriculum. All lessons are based on the four major themes of ‘Awareness, Appreciation, Action and Advocacy’ and cover topics such as cyberbullying, cybersecurity, gaming addiction and fake news. These lessons supplement the routines set by teachers during lessons on responsible use of mobile devices. You may click&nbsp;[here](https://admiraltysec.moe.edu.sg/useful-information/cyberwellness-partnership)&nbsp;for useful resources on cyberwellness.

**Student Leadership**  

**8.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What are the Student Leadership opportunities available in Admiralty Secondary School?**

At Admiralty Secondary, we believe that Every Admiral is a Leader. All Admirals are equipped with basic leadership skills through the Learning for Life programme (LLP). Guided by Kouzes and Posner’s The Leadership Challenge, the LLP aims to develop mindful leaders through community outreach.

Students who display outstanding leadership potential are formally appointed and trained to take on leadership roles:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Board (e.g., Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders and Subject Representatives)

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCA Board (e.g., Executive committee members)

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Council&nbsp;

Student leaders will initiate, plan and organise school events at various scales, such as the Secondary One Orientation, Staff Appreciation Day and NE Commemorative events.

Please refer to the 2020 Student Handbook (page 55) for more information on the leadership opportunities for Admirals.  
  

**Progression Pathways**

**9.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**How does ADSS support students in determining suitable post-secondary pathway?**

The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme in ADSS focuses on important educational milestones of a student’s journey through secondary school. The focus for each level is as follows:

ECG is conducted through formal curriculum during CCE lessons, and also additional programmes such as:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning journeys to the post-secondary educational institutions

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) and Elective Modules (EM) offered by polytechnics and ITE

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing by industry professionals

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECG counselling

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal statement writing and interview skills workshops to prepare students for Early Admissions Exercise (EAE)

&nbsp;Through these lessons and programmes, we hope to nurture Admirals who are able to navigate the post-secondary pathways with confidence, and make considered decisions on how to achieve their education and career goals.

**Code of Conduct:**

**10.**&nbsp;&nbsp;**Are students allowed to bring mobile phones to school?**

The school believes in inculcating responsibility in the use of mobile devices and, therefore, allows students to bring their mobile phones to school. There is a mobile device policy to guide our students, and this can be found on pg 64 of the 2020 Student Handbook.
