Parents Gateway FAQ
-------------------

1.     Is Parents Gateway going to replace Google Hangout?

Parents Gateway is a one-way communication channel for schools to disseminate information about activities and programmes, and for parents’ consent and acknowledgement. It does not have a messaging function.  Google Hangout is a two-way communication messaging tool between FTs and parent, with other parents in the same group (like a Whatsapp chatgroup).  Therefore Parents Gateway and Google Hangout will still be used in school.

  

2.     Who can access Parents Gateway?

Parents Gateway contains sensitive information about students and their parents. Access to the mobile app is restricted to parents and legal guardians who are Singpass holders. If you fall into any of the following categories, you are eligible to apply for SingPass:

(v)            Dependant Pass holders (of EP, PEP, EntrePass and S-Pass holders)
