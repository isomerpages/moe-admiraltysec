The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to seek admission to a participating secondary school based on their talents and achievements before the release of their PSLE results. Students may consider applying for a secondary school through DSA-Sec if they are able to identify a school that offers a talent development programme in their area of strength, as well as commit to developing their talents in the chosen DSA area, in that particular school.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
