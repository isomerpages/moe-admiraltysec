<p>The annual DSA-Sec Exercise allows Primary 6 students to seek admission
to a participating secondary school based on their talents and achievements
before the release of their PSLE results. Students may consider applying
for a secondary school through DSA-Sec if they are able to identify a school
that offers a talent development programme in their area of strength, as
well as commit to developing their talents in the chosen DSA area, in that
particular school.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities
related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
